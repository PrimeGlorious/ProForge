        <p class="text-muted mb-4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
          ProForge is a job platform built around focus and simplicity.
          No distractions, no noise — just clear listings, real companies, and a direct path between them and professionals.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted mb-4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
          We’re not here to gamify hiring or turn it into a circus.
          There’s no points, no badges, no endless steps — just jobs and people who want to work.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted mb-4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
          We don’t serve ads. We don’t sell profiles.
          ProForge is independent, product-driven, and not built for exit strategies — it’s built to be used.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted" style="line-height: 1.8;">
          Launched in 2025. No buzzwords. Just the essentials.
